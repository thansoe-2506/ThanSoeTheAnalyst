handling and solving daily feedbacks from various channels, slack, viber, Microsoft Dynamic 365, and TOUR Map(Tickets of Urgent Request Map Ops)
Prepared detailed reports and delivered presentations to Program Managers (PgMs) and regional teams, showcasing project progress and actionable insights.
Worked closely with cross-functional teams to understand data needs and improve map accuracy, 
leading Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with drivers and bikers to gather feedback.


TOUR Map Request (Tickets of Urgent Request)
I handled and solved the requests from other teams, grab food or grab taxi
for grab food, we normally got the tickets like the creation of geofence based on high demand area to give incentives to bikers
to prior this area in Yangon, Mandalay, Naypyidaw, Pathein and Mawlamyine
same for the taxi also, give incentives to drivers when there is campaign that area is created by Map Ops
Map Ops handled POI data, if other department want to know high booking POI, I use SQL to retrieved data and give to them
